# Reddit Research Project
This is the code for my research project for AP Capstone Research. This project focused on finding the correlation coefficients of 50,000 Reddit comments from r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets, and r/investing and comparing the monthly volume of activity and percent change in activity to tech stock prices.

This program runs purely in the command line, however, should be easily modifiable in the codebase. You can collect as many Reddit comments as you want and can collect data from any subreddit and number of stocks as you please. 

# How to Run
1. In order to perform your own research, you must first modify the code to your needs first, and then run the RedditData.py file. Once this is finished, JSON files will be generated in order to store the data collected.
2. Then, run the Analysis.py file, which will do a total analysis of the JSON database which was created. Keep in mind, you may need to change the parameters of how the program is analyzing the data to your needs first.
