# RedditResearchProject
This is the code to my research project for AP Capstone Research. This project focused on finding the correlation coefficients of 50,000 Reddit comments from r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets and r/investing and comparing the monthly volume of activity and percent change in activity to tech stock prices.
